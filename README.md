# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Capstone Project

## Problem Statement:
The problem statement for this project is to build a classification model to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Given the significant class imbalance in the dataset, it's imperative to address this issue before constructing our classification model.
Our primary objective in this project is to develop a model capable of accurately predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.

## Data Dictionary:  
  
The dataset captures credit card transactions conducted by European cardholders over a span of two days. 
Among the 284,807 transactions recorded, there were 492 instances of fraud. Notably, frauds represent a mere 0.172% of the 
total transactions, indicating a highly imbalanced dataset.

## Project Pipeline:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Analyze and understand the data to identify patterns, relationships, and trends in the data by using Descriptive Statistics and Visualizations.
- **Data Cleaning:** This might include standardization, and handling the missing values and outliers in the data.
- **Dealing with Imbalanced data:** This data set is highly imbalanced. The data should be balanced using the appropriate methods before moving on to model building.
- **Feature Engineering:** Create new features or transform the existing features for better performance of the ML Models.
- **Model Selection:** Choose the most appropriate model that can be used for this project.
- **Model Training:** Split the data into train & test sets and use the train set to estimate the best model parameters.
- **Model Validation:** Evaluate the performance of the model on data that was not used during the training process. The goal is to estimate the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data and to identify any issues with the model, such as overfitting.
- **Model Deployment:** Model deployment is the process of making a trained machine learning model available for use in a production environment.
